# Memory-Game
This Tkinter-based Python script implements a memory game where players match pairs of shuffled cards with identical symbols by clicking on them. Successful matches keep cards face-up, while mismatches flip them back. The game features a reset button for reshuffling cards and an exit button to close the application.
